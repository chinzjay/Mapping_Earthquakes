# Mapping_Earthquakes
## Overview
The purpose of this project is to create a earthquake map with the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth and to visualize all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the mapalong with a third map.
## Results
- In Deliverable 1, using JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and geoJSON data, tectonic plate data is added using d3.json(), and the tectonic plate is set to stand out on the map using LineStrings. The tectonic plate data is added to the overlay object with the earthquake data *(Fig 1).*

- In Deliverable 2, all major earthquake data is added to the map using d3.json(). The color and radius of the circle markers has been added based on the magnitude of earthquake, and a popup marker for each earthquake that displays the magnitude and location of the earthquake *(Fig 2).*

- In Deliverable 3,  a third map style is added to the earthquake map *(Fig 3).*
